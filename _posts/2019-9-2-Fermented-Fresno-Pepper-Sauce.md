title: Fermented Fresno Pepper Sauce
---

I'm very pleased with the bright red color of this fermented pepper sauce.

- 5 cloves of garlic
- 1 tbsp coriander seed
- 1 lb red fresno peppers

The peppers are mild and sweet, with a pleasant fruity heat. I decided to leave the seeds in to balance the sweetness of the red pepper.

They were fermented for two days in a 2.5% salt brine, then immersion blended with some of the brine. Room temperature here is warm, around 76-77&deg;F

I am going to save the excess brine to kickstart the next batch of sauce and to use as a salty, savory and acidic seasoning for cooking.
