Hi, I'm Nikhil.

I live in sunny and idyllic Claremont, California, a.k.a. the city of trees and PhDs. Coincidentally, I earned a PhD, and I hope to one day become a tree.

### This blog

 I like to grow things and eat things. This blog is where I document my projects. I create and own all the content on this site, and I don't want to share any photos or data with a 3rd party. I am using Github pages to host, and a minimalist theme called [Jekyll-Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now.git) by Barry Clark. It was the first theme I found that doesn't require additional plugins or building the site locally.
